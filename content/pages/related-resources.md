Web Resources
-------------

Here is an Other Minds bibliography (to be updated--let me know of any additions).

On writing, see Jim Pryor's [Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html), and Strunk's [Elements of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html).

Useful glossaries are Jim Pryor's Philosophical Terms and Methods and the [Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind](http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/).

David Chalmers' [Web Resources Relating to Consciousness, and Such](http://consc.net/resources/) is well worth browsing, as is his [website](http://consc.net/chalmers/).

The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html) (SEP) is excellent, but far from complete.

See the [MIT philosophy](http://mit.edu/philos/www/) page for colloquia dates, other philosophy subject information, etc.
